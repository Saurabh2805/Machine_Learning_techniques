# Problem Statement

DonorsChoose.org has funded over 1.1 million classroom requests through the support of 3 million donors, the majority of whom were making 
their first-ever donation to a public school. If DonorsChoose.org can motivate even a fraction of those donors to make another donation, 
that could have a huge impact on the number of classroom requests fulfilled.

# Objective:

The goal of the competition is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, 
using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. DonorsChoose.org can then 
use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.

# Details about this repo:

In this repo, I have applied various Machine Learning Techniques like Knn, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, RF and 
XGBosst on the Donor's choose dataset. The aim here is to get the best model that can help us to distinguish between approved and rejected 
projects.
